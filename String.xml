    <string name="Description">IoT or Internet of things is also in list of today\'s Trending Technologies.
        The soil moisture sensor is a simple device for measuring the moisture level in soil and similar materials.
        The soil moisture sensor is straight forward to use.
    The Soil Moisture Sensor uses capacitance to measure dielectric permittivity of
        the surrounding medium. In soil, dielectric permittivity is a function of the water content.
        The sensor creates a voltage proportional to the dielectric permittivity,
        and therefore the water content of the soil. <b/>
        Measuring soil moisture is important for agricultural applications to
        help farmers manage their irrigation systems efficiently. Knowing
        the requirements of soil moisture conditions
        for the fields, enables the farmers to use lesser water and increase
        the yield and quality of the crop.
